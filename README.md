# Activity Tracker for Mac OS

A simple, focused system tray application that tracks your computer activity, built with Go. Created out of frustration with macOS's native Screen Time feature, which has proven to be unreliable and problematic.

## Why Another Activity Tracker?

This project exists because the native macOS Screen Time tracking is fundamentally broken - it often fails to track activity correctly, provides inconsistent data, and is overly complex. Instead of trying to do everything, this application does one thing and does it well: tracking your actual computer activity time accurately and reliably.

## Features

- Lives quietly in your system tray
- Monitors computer activity and idle time with precision
- Built with native Go libraries for optimal performance
- Simple by design - no bloat, no unnecessary features

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.22.2 or higher

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/activity_tracker.git
cd activity_tracker
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
go mod download
```

3. Build the application:
```bash
go build
```

## Usage

Run the application:
```bash
./activity_tracker
```

The application will appear in your system tray.

## Adding to macOS Startup

To make the activity tracker start automatically when you log in to your Mac:

1. Create a Launch Agent:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/Library/LaunchAgents
   ```

2. Create a new file named `com.user.activity_tracker.plist` in the LaunchAgents directory with the following content (replace the path with your actual build path):
   ```xml
   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
   <plist version="1.0">
   <dict>
       <key>Label</key>
       <string>com.user.activity_tracker</string>
       <key>ProgramArguments</key>
       <array>
           <string>/path/to/your/activity_tracker</string>
       </array>
       <key>RunAtLoad</key>
       <true/>
       <key>KeepAlive</key>
       <true/>
   </dict>
   </plist>
   ```

3. Load the Launch Agent:
   ```bash
   launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.user.activity_tracker.plist
   ```

Alternatively, you can also add the application to your Login Items:

1. Open System Settings
2. Go to General > Login Items
3. Click the '+' button
4. Navigate to and select your activity_tracker executable
5. The application will now start automatically when you log in
